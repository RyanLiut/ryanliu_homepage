## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Humanities at Tsinghua University. My major is computational linguistics, combining artificial intelligence and natural languages. I am interested in computational lexical semantics (including polysemy, ambiguity and uncertainty) and AI interpretability for LLMs.

## Talks
  * **To know, or not to know? Language, Uncertainty and Artificial Intelligence**
  
    At Shanxi University of Finance and Economnics, June 12th, [[PPT](/projects/pre_山西财经大学.pdf)]

    In this talk, I reviewed my recent research from a philosophical perspective of epistemology: What does the model not know? (Known Knowns) What does the model unknow? (Known Unknowns).

  * **Evaluation agentiveness of Subject-object reversible sentences in LLMs**

    At a linguistic seminar, November 26th, [[PPT](/projects/刘柱-语言学论坛展示.pdf)]

    In this talk, I employ difference vetors in LLMs to represent agentiveness of different components (SVO) in a reversible but meaning-preserving sentence pair.

  * **A Top-down Graph-based Tool for Modeling Classical Semantic Maps: A Crosslinguistic Case Study of Supplementary Adverbs**

    At a linguistic seminar, November 30th, 2025. [[PPT in Chinese](/projects/forum-6-pre.pdf)] [[Paper](/projects/forum-6-paper.pdf)] [[CODE](https://github.com/RyanLiut/SemanticMapModel)]

    In this talk, I develop a graph algorithm to construct the semantic map automatically. The tool is available now, and feel free to use it.
