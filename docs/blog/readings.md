Here are some books, movies, and performances that I've checked out in the last six months (from January 1st to June 19th, 2023). I usually try to jot down my thoughts after finishing each one, but I missed a few due to being busy. (Some of them were so good that they made a lasting impression though!) I've tried my best to translate the Chinese titles into English. I've also given each work my own personal rating from one star to five stars.



## Books :book:

1. 《汉语的词库与词法》 董秀芳 Chinese Lexicon and Morphology

   :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:    

   I recently read a linguistic book that delves deeply into Chinese compounds. The book covers the morphological rules, semantic structures, and one special morpheme (the authors call it a "semi-free morpheme"). It gave me plenty of inspiration on how to analyze linguistic materials and turn them into solid knowledge. What's interesting is that I saw the book as more of a guide for computational linguistics rather than just traditional linguistics. In fact, reading this book motivated me to undertake a project in one of my linguistic classes. The writing style is both concise and easy to follow, making it a thoroughly enjoyable read!

   

2. 《唐诗选注》 欧丽娟 Selected Annotations of Tang Poems    (unfinished)

   :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

   The Tang Dynasty is renowned for its poetry, and many Chinese students are familiar with some of its most famous works. I adore Tang poems for their elegance, beauty, concision, and symmetry. This book introduced me to even more poems from this magnificent era by poets such as Wang Wei, Li Bo, Du Fu, Qian, Shen, and Song. Though they share certain stylistic traits, each poet expresses their own unique emotions, which still resonate with people today. Whenever I'm by a river, on a lawn, or near a tree, I read their words aloud and feel the beauty of their work. Ms. Ou provides just the right amount of annotations and her introductions to the poets are comprehensive and impressive. I initially bought the book during my master's program last year, but unfortunately lost it at the library. So, I had to buy it again last semester when I started at my new school. While I haven't finished reading it yet because I'm taking my time, I have made it through around two-thirds of the book so far.

   

3. 《史记》司马迁 中华书局 A history record by SiMa qian       (unfinished)

   :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

   This is the book I read before my afternoon nap. It's a historical work that covers the period from Chun Qiu and Zhan Guo to the Western Han dynasty. When I first spotted it at the library, I randomly picked out one of its volumes, which happened to be number 7. That became my introduction to the characters and events recorded within. Among them were figures like Shu Qi, Bo Yi, Wu Zi Xu, Shang Yang, Sun Bin, Su Qin, Bai Qi, Wang Jian, and others. These people were either generals, high-ranking officials, or brothers of the emperor, with wealth and fame abounding. However, many of them also met tragic ends. Dr. Sima, the author, sometimes focuses on certain details while omitting others. Nevertheless, the characters he portrays feel fresh and genuine. Reading this book is like experiencing a real war (or, as we say in Chinese, 刀光剑影), and it occasionally even seeps into my afternoon dreams!

   

4. 《管锥篇》 钱钟书    Notes on Chinese classic literatures     (unfinished)

   :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

   Once a week, usually on Mondays, I read this book to avoid the crowded and hectic lunch hour after class. I also read it during my time at master's school, but now I'm reading it with greater care, poring over each page. The author's humor and his choice of topics never fail to amuse me. I find the way he brings together different languages to convey similar contents to be particularly fascinating!

   

5. 《理想国》 柏拉图 The republic 

   :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

   I've read this book twice, and it's a true classic. The first time I read it, I was influenced to study piano after reading the music-related part in the book. The second time I read it, I was touched by the many details, and I gained a deeper understanding of the logic behind Socrates' (or Plato's?) ideas. It's a truly comprehensive book that covers a wide range of topics that are still discussed and even debated today. I particularly enjoy the conversational style that is used throughout the text. It really brings the dialogue to life!

## Operas

1. Tosca 

   In National Centre for the Performing Arts on June 10th

   :star: :star: :star: :star: 

   I went to my first live opera recently after having watched Tosca online before. The third act was my favorite, especially when the shepherd boy recited the beautiful poem with music in the background. The melody was absolutely enchanting! However, I was slightly disappointed by the volume of the performance. It wasn't as loud as I had hoped, and the distant sound made it less immersive than I expected.

2. Madama Butterfly 

   [Online Bilibli](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PA411i7T4/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=ceea752163919a5568e7188629325c2f)

    :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

   Really bravoooo! The music and singing were both so enchanting and beautiful. Even after I finished watching it, the melodies kept swirling around in my head. Madama Butterfly's tragic story was so heart-breaking, especially during her classic song 'Un bel di' when she imagined Pinkerton coming back. It was both romantic and sad at the same time. I really enjoyed the whole opera (I mean, I even replayed some of the songs afterwards :).

3. Turando

   [Online Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eW411v72W/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click) 

   :star: :star: :star: :star: 

   Puccini's another great masterpiece! And the story is set in Beijing, China. It features many Chinese elements such as a princess, palace, and even the main theme of Turandot is based on the Chinese folk song 'Mo Li Hua' (Jasmine Flower). It's fascinating to see the fusion of Western and Eastern cultures in this opera. I really enjoyed it!

4. Beijing Opera: 凤还巢

   长安大戏院

    :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

   I found it absolutely fascinating (I even clapped excitedly at the end)! The story might have been a bit cliché, but the lyrics and music were really good!

5. Beijing Opera: 春草闯堂

   新清学堂

    :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

6. Beijing Opera: 除三害

   长安大戏院



## Symphony

1. Dvořák Symphony No. 8; Night on the Barren Mountain; Siegfried Idyll

   新清华学堂

    :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

   I absolutely loved Chapter four in No.8, especially when the trumpet came in. The whole symphony is so rhythmic and lively. And don't even get me started on the beautiful flute solo - it was simply enchanting!

2. 《火之舞》《陌上花开》《社戏》

   国家大剧院

   :star: :star: :star: ​

   It's interesting that they are playing Chinese traditional music with Western instruments, but I have to admit, it feels a bit strange to me. The combination of Eastern and Western music creates a unique sound that may take some getting used to. However, it's great to see different cultures influencing and inspiring one another in the world of music.
