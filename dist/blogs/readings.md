Here are parts of my books, movies, performances, etc I have read or watched in the last half year (2023.01.01-2023.06.19). Although I have habits of recording them after I finished them, I still missed some of the work which I did not write them in time. (Some are so impressive that carved into my heart, though:). For Chinese name, I try my best to translate into English. I give my *personal* staring on each work (one star to five stars)



## Books :book:

1. 《汉语的词库与词法》 董秀芳 Chinese Lexicon and Morphology

   :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:    

   This linguistic book talks much about Chinese compounds, including its morphological rules, semantic structures, and one special morphemes (the authors call it "semi-free morpheme"). The book gives me much inspiration on how to analyze linguistic materials (data) into some solid knowledge. Interestingly, I saw the book as a guidance of computational linguistics, rather than traditional one, and this book motivated one of my projects on one linguistic class. The writing style is concise and readable. I really enjoyed it! 

2. 《唐诗选注》 欧丽娟 Selected Annotations of Tang Poems    (unfinished)

   :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

   Tang Dynasty is famous for its poems, some of which Chinese students are very familiar. I really love Tang poems, for its elegance, beauty, condensed and symmetrical. This book gives me more poems of this great time by poets, like Wang Wei, Li Bo, Du Fu, Qian, Shen, Song... They have some common and special styles, and express their own emotions, which largely shared my people in our times. Every time when I stand by the river, on the lawn, by the tree, I read their words loud and I could feel the beauty behind the work. Ms. Ou collects sufficient but not too much annotations and her introduction to the poets is comprehensive and impressive. I bought the book when I was in my master school last year but was missed at the library unfortunately:( I bought it again last semester when I entered at my new school. I read it not fast, so I only read around two thirds.

3. 《史记》司马迁 中华书局 A history record by SiMa qian       (unfinished)

   :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

   This is my reading book before I went to noon sleep. The historical book records the history from Chun Qiu and Zhan Guo to the West Han. When I first saw it at the library, I chose one of the books randomly, and its number is 7, so that is my first reading of the recorded characters. 叔齐、伯夷、伍子胥、商鞅、孙膑、苏秦、白起、王翦 and ect. These are from the part of 列传, which tells about some generals, officers with high rank, or brothers of the emperor. They were rich and famous but most of them have a tragic faith. Dr. Sima somehow focuses on some details while in most cases, he omit much. But you still feel many fresh and truly characters. It is a wonderful as to experience a real war (in Chinese, I would say 刀光剑影), and sometime it even comes into my noon dream!

4. 《管锥篇》 钱钟书    Notes on Chinese classic literatures     (unfinished)

   :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

   I read this book about once a week, when I leave a class on Monday to avoid the crowded and disaster lunch time. I also read the book at my master school, but this time I decided to read each page carefully. I was alway amused by the materials the humorous author chose. The meeting of different languages for the similar content is always fascinating!
