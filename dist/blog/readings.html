I usually try to jot down my thoughts after finishing each one, but I missed a few due to being busy. (Some of them were so good that they made a lasting impression though!) I've tried my best to translate the Chinese titles into English. I've also given each work my own personal rating from one star to five stars.</p> <h2 id="books">Books 📖</h2> <ol><li><p>《汉语的词库与词法》 董秀芳 Chinese Lexicon and Morphology</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>I recently read a linguistic book that delves deeply into Chinese compounds. The book covers the morphological rules, semantic structures, and one special morpheme (the authors call it a &quot;semi-free morpheme&quot;). It gave me plenty of inspiration on how to analyze linguistic materials and turn them into solid knowledge. What's interesting is that I saw the book as more of a guide for computational linguistics rather than just traditional linguistics. In fact, reading this book motivated me to undertake a project in one of my linguistic classes. The writing style is both concise and easy to follow, making it a thoroughly enjoyable read!</p></li> <li><p>《词汇化 汉语双音词的衍生和发展》 董秀芳 Lexicalization The origin and evolution of Chinese Disyllabic Words</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>Another academic book written by Prossfer Dong, which was scrached from her PhD thesis. I had the pleasure of reading in its original traditional vertical Chinese format. Instead of synchronic morphologic rules (as in her next book), this book focuses on diachronic lexicalization, exploring how phrases evlove into words over time? Different larger units are discussed into several chapters, including six phrasal structures (联合、偏正、动宾、主谓、连谓、动补), syntax and neighboring parts across two grammar categories. I really enjoy reading this book too due to its comprehensive examples, explanations, and summarizations. It felt like reading a fascinating historical account of Chinese words and capturing a connection between anicent traditional Chinese to modern everyday langauge.</p></li> <li><p>《唐诗选注》 欧丽娟 Selected Annotations of Tang Poems    (almost finished)</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>The Tang Dynasty is renowned for its poetry, and many Chinese students are familiar with some of its most famous works. I adore Tang poems for their elegance, beauty, concision, and symmetry. This book introduced me to even more poems from this magnificent era by poets such as Wang Wei, Li Bo, Du Fu, Qian, Shen, Song, Han Yu, Meng Haoran, Wang Wei, Wei Yingwu, Yuan Bai and Li Ho. Though they share certain stylistic traits, each poet expresses their own unique emotions, which still resonate with people today. Whenever I'm by a river, on a lawn, or near a tree, I read their words aloud and feel the beauty of their work. Ms. Ou provides just the right amount of annotations and her introductions to the poets are comprehensive and impressive. I initially bought the book during my master's program last year, but unfortunately lost it at the library. So, I had to buy it again last semester when I started at my new school. While I haven't finished reading it yet because I'm taking my time, I have made it through around two-thirds of the book so far.</p> <p>[Update: 2024 July] I have finished reading this book (lasting around 2 years:/). Like the author said, this book provides me with &quot;a highly advanced civilization&quot;. The beauty, honesty and goodness behind the text really move and motivate me. Different periods also mean different scenes, and I am rather attracted by all the scences.</p></li> <li><p>《史记》司马迁 中华书局 A history record by SiMa qian       (unfinished)</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>This is the book I read before my afternoon nap. It's a historical work that covers the period from Chun Qiu and Zhan Guo to the Western Han dynasty. When I first spotted it at the library, I randomly picked out one of its volumes, which happened to be number 7. (now to the end of 8) That became my introduction to the characters and events recorded within. Among them were figures like Shu Qi, Bo Yi, Wu Zi Xu, Shang Yang, Sun Bin, Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Wu zixu, Lian Po, Ling xiangru, Bai Qi, Wang Jian, Jing Ke, Li Si and others. These people were either generals, high-ranking officials, or brothers of the emperor, with wealth and fame abounding. However, many of them also met tragic ends. Dr. Sima, the author, sometimes focuses on certain details while omitting others. Nevertheless, the characters he portrays feel fresh and genuine. Reading this book is like experiencing a real war (or, as we say in Chinese, 刀光剑影), and it occasionally even seeps into my afternoon dreams!</p> <p>[Update] One biography of General Li makes me tear a lot. He, his grandson Ling Li, and the author Dr Sima, what tragic heros they are!</p></li> <li><p>《管锥篇》 钱钟书    Notes on Chinese classic literatures     (unfinished)</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>Once a week, usually on Mondays, I read this book to avoid the crowded and hectic lunch hour after class. I also read it during my time at master's school, but now I'm reading it with greater care, poring over each page. The author's humor and his choice of topics never fail to amuse me. I find the way he brings together different languages to convey similar contents to be particularly fascinating!</p></li> <li><p>《理想国》 柏拉图 The republic</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>I've read this book twice, and it's a true classic. The first time I read it, I was influenced to study piano after reading the music-related part in the book. The second time I read it, I was touched by the many details, and I gained a deeper understanding of the logic behind Socrates' (or Plato's?) ideas. It's a truly comprehensive book that covers a wide range of topics that are still discussed and even debated today. I particularly enjoy the conversational style that is used throughout the text. It really brings the dialogue to life!</p></li> <li><p>《不能承受的生命之轻》 米兰·昆德拉 The Unbearable Lightness of Being</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>The really supervised and wonderful book I've read this year! The novel mixed with philosophy touched me a lot. The relative concepts are contrastive, mutually exclusive, alternative and finally convertible. This inspired me much!</p></li> <li><p>《把自己当作方法》和一系列对项飙的访谈 The Self as Method: In Conversation with Biao Xiang</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>A series of interview (including articles in WeChat) with sociologist Biao Xiang. I am really interested in and also moved by his kindness, insights and (kinda) compassion.</p></li> <li><p>《金榜题名后·大学生出路分化之谜》 Yajun Zheng</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p></li> <li><p>《浮士德》 Faust  Goethe</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>A wonderful and classical playbook by the well-known author and I really enjoyed that! It involves various topics, like aesthetics, philosophy, arts, dramatic languages and fairy tales. A magic and colorful journey~</p></li> <li><p>《时代的精神状况》 卡尔·雅斯贝斯 (Second Time)</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>A concise but encompassing philosophical book!</p></li> <li><p>《少年维特之烦恼》 The Sorrows of Young Werther Goethe</p> <p>2024 May</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>Another wonderful and poetic epistolary novel written by Goethe. I am really immersed by the emotions of Werther, and reached a peak when he reads the poetry of Ossian.</p></li> <li><p>Case for case</p> <p>2024 July</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p></li> <li><p>《回归语文学》 A return to philology</p> <p>2024 August</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>A really insightful book, which is both academical and easy to follow. The author is our director of Chinese Department, who presented a similar topic at oriental lectures. I was attracted then, because it encourages an art of &quot;close reading&quot; (classics). This book gives a more thorough and systematic to this - a return to philology. The author uses his research experience and majors to emphysize that philology really matters although it is overlooked these days when more and more people pursue theory. That is really true and the two categories, philosophy and philology, are widely recognized in many areas.</p></li> <li><p>《失乐园》 Paradise Lost</p> <p>2024 October</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>Another classic, and also a religious work, by the English poet Milton. It’s based on the story of Adam and Eve and tells how evil deceives Eve into eating the apple from the Tree of Knowledge. Like Homer’s poem, this one is also about a war—epic and musical in its own right!</p></li> <li><p>Iliad 《伊利亚特》</p> <p>2024 December</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>I was completely captivated by this classic epic poem by Homer! The tragic tale and the heroes' journeys brought me through a whirlwind of emotions—sorrow, love, jealousy, and even hatred. The characters, the words, the vivid scenes—it's easy to see why it’s called an &quot;epic&quot;! This was my first dive into Western ancient history, and it feels so different from Chinese classical literature like the Shijing. In Homer’s epic, the emotions and motivations of individuals, heroes, and even gods play a central role in the battles. The gods are powerful yet emotional, and they have a way of explaining the fortunes and fates of humans—ones that we can’t always change. (Sometimes I feel braver in certain situations. Maybe a god is pulling the strings behind the scenes? 😃 ) Overall, the book is musical, vibrant, and all-encompassing, and I’ve gained so much from it!</p></li> <li><p>The Art of Loving 《爱的艺术》</p> <p>2025 January</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>This is both a theoretical and practical book that explores what love is and how to love. Fromm dives deeper into the theory (which reminds me of Hegel's Vorlesungen über die Ästhetik), and he breaks down different types of love. His philosophy draws a distinction between man-like and woman-like traits, suggesting that love is about integrating these two sides. Love, according to Fromm, is an art that must be learned, involving qualities like respect and empathy, as well as the ability to see things from someone else’s perspective. Some of the practical advice he offers is to enjoy the loneliness when we only have ourselves. I think this book, at the very least, has given me a sense of warmth and confidence when it comes to love.</p></li></ol> <h2 id="operas">Operas</h2> <ol><li><p>Tosca</p> <p>In National Centre for the Performing Arts on June 10th</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>I went to my first live opera recently after having watched Tosca online before. The third act was my favorite, especially when the shepherd boy recited the beautiful poem with music in the background. The melody was absolutely enchanting! However, I was slightly disappointed by the volume of the performance. It wasn't as loud as I had hoped, and the distant sound made it less immersive than I expected.</p></li> <li><p>Madama Butterfly</p> <p><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PA411i7T4/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&amp;vd_source=ceea752163919a5568e7188629325c2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Bilibli<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>Really bravoooo! The music and singing were both so enchanting and beautiful. Even after I finished watching it, the melodies kept swirling around in my head. Madama Butterfly's tragic story was so heart-breaking, especially during her classic song 'Un bel di' when she imagined Pinkerton coming back. It was both romantic and sad at the same time. I really enjoyed the whole opera (I mean, I even replayed some of the songs afterwards 😃.</p></li> <li><p>Turando</p> <p><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eW411v72W/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Bilibili<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>Puccini's another great masterpiece! And the story is set in Beijing, China. It features many Chinese elements such as a princess, palace, and even the main theme of Turandot is based on the Chinese folk song 'Mo Li Hua' (Jasmine Flower). It's fascinating to see the fusion of Western and Eastern cultures in this opera. I really enjoyed it!</p></li> <li><p>Beijing Opera: 凤还巢</p> <p>长安大戏院</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>I found it absolutely fascinating (I even clapped excitedly at the end)!

The combination of Eastern and Western music creates a unique sound that may take some getting used to. However, it's great to see different cultures influencing and inspiring one another in the world of music.</p></li> <li><p>Symphony No. 8 in C minor, WAB 108</p> <p>在线</p> <p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p> <p>You can always be moved by Anton Bruckner's slow movement, and among his well-known works, the third movement of his Symphony No.8 stands out as the most captivating. The strings evoke vast, &quot;grand&quot; images - like the sky, the sea, time, space, infinity, eternity-transporting your mind. The violin, viola and cello represent different height of voice and perfectly form an amazing 3D space.
