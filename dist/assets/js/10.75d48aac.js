Additionally, we employ anisotropy removal techniques to enhance performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, particularly for Subtask 2.

In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based algorithm that automatically generates conceptual spaces and SMMs in a top-down manner. The algorithm begins by creating a dense graph, which is subsequently pruned into maximum spanning trees, selected according to metrics we propose. These evaluation metrics include both intrinsic and extrinsic measures, considering factors such as network structure and the trade-off between precision and coverage.

Existing supervised methods treat WSD as a classification task and have achieved remarkable performance. However, they ignore uncertainty estimation (UE) in the real-world setting, where the data is always noisy and out of distribution. This paper extensively studies UE on the benchmark designed for WSD. Specifically, we first compare four uncertainty scores for a state-of-the-art WSD model and verify that the conventional predictive probabilities obtained at the end of the model are inadequate to quantify uncertainty. Then, we examine the capability of capturing data and model uncertainties by the model with the selected UE score on well-designed test scenarios and discover that the model reflects data uncertainty satisfactorily but underestimates model uncertainty. Furthermore, we explore numerous lexical properties that intrinsically affect data uncertainty and provide a detailed analysis of four critical aspects: the syntactic category, morphology, sense granularity, and semantic relations.\n  ")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("["),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.245/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Paper"),a("OutboundLink")],1),e._v("]["),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/RyanLiut/WSD-UE",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("CODE"),a("OutboundLink")],1),e._v("] ["),a("a",{attrs:{href:"/projects/poster.pdf"}},[e._v("Poster")]),e._v("] ["),a("a",{attrs:{href:"/projects/main_wo_video.pdf"}},[e._v("PPT")]),e._v("]")])]),e._v(" "),a("ProjectCard",[a("p",[a("strong",[e._v("Show, Tell and Rephrase: Diverse Video Captioning via Two-Stage Progressive Training")])]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("code",[e._v("TMM 2022")])]),e._v(" "),a("details",[a("summary",[e._v("\n  Describing a video using natural language is an inherently one-to-many translation task.

However, such a paradigm neglects set-level relationships among captions from the same video, not fully capturing the underlying multimodality of the generative process. To overcome this shortcoming, we leverage neighbouring descriptions for the same video that are articulated with noticeable topics and language variations (i.e., paraphrases). To this end, we propose a novel progressive training method by decomposing the learning of latent variables into two stages that are topic-oriented and paraphrase-oriented, respectively. Specifically, the model learns from divergent topic sentences obtained by semantic-based clustering in the first stage. It is then trained again through paraphrases with a cluster-aware adaptive regularization, allowing more intra-cluster variations. Furthermore, we introduce an overall metric DAUM, a D iversity- A ccuracy U nified M etric to consider both the precision of the generated caption set and its coverage on the reference set, which has proved to have a higher correlation with human judgment than previous precision-only metrics.
